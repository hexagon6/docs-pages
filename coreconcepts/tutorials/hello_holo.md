# Hello Holo Tutorial

Let's begin with the classic Hello ~~World~~ Holo tutorial!
You will see it's super easy to create a distributed application with Holochain.

### Setup

1. Complete the [installation guide](https://developer.holochain.org/start.html). This will give you an app development environment including the Holochain developer tool `hc`.
2. Open up a terminal (command prompt in Windows).
3. Enter the development environment.  
macOS/Linux (you'll remember this command from the installation tutorial):  
```bash
nix-shell https://holochain.love
```
Windows (do this in the place where you installed Holochain):
```cmd
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
nix-shell https://holochain.love
```

## Initializing your new app

Pick a new home for all your future Holochain applications to live. Something like  `home_directory/holochain/`.

Then create a `coreconcepts` folder for this tutorial series:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir holochain 
cd holochain
mkdir coreconcepts
cd coreconcepts
``` 

Time to put the holochain command line tool (`hc`) to work and make your app.

Initialize a new app and enter the app directory:

!!! note "Run in `nix-shell`"
    ```bash
    hc init cc_tuts
    cd cc_tuts 
    ```

#### Compile 

It's an always good to frequently compile your app. That way you catch any mistakes early on. 

Give it a go by asking `hc` to package your app:

!!! note "Run in `nix-shell`"
    ```bash
    hc package
    ```

Packaging your app means you are compiling the code into a DNA file and getting it ready to be run.


!!! success "You should see a successful compilation like this:"
    ```json
    Created DNA package file at "/Users/username/holochain/testing_tuts/hello_holo/dist/hello_holo.dna.json"
    DNA hash: QmY7rhg4sf6xqQMRL1u1CnXVgmamTfxC59c9RaoFqM2eRs
    ```

## Generate a zome

Your app doesn't really do too much right now because it needs a [zome](https://developer.holochain.org/guide/latest/zome/welcome.html). A zome is Holochain's way of organizing code into nice units that perform a certain task (like saying hello).

Generate a zome called `hello` inside the zome's folder:

!!! note "Run in `nix-shell`"
    ```bash
    hc generate zomes/hello rust-proc
    ```

#### Compile

!!! note "Run in `nix-shell`"
    ```bash
    hc package
    ```

> Zomes can take a little while to compile the first time. Compiling will be much faster the next time you do it. Feel free to move on with the tutorial while your app compiles.


!!! success "If all went well you should see:"
    ```bash
    > cargo build --release --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown --target-dir=target
       Compiling hello v0.1.0 (/Users/username/holochain/core_concepts/hello_hollo/zomes/hello/code)
        Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 11.95s
    > cargo build --release --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown --target-dir=target
        Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.50s
    Created DNA package file at "/Users/username/holochain/core_concepts/hello_hollo/dist/hello_hollo.dna.json"
    DNA hash: QmdNyxke1Z9Kunws4WUXHnt4cdKQnPogC7YPpfQx67fo1z
    ```

## Folder layout 

#### Look at the folder layout

![Folder Layout](../img/folder_layout.png)

#### Open the `lib.rs` file

The zome is a [Rust](https://rust-lang.com) project and makes use of [macros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html#the-difference-between-macros-and-functions) so you can avoid writing a lot of boilerplate code. The main file you will be editing is `hello_hollo/zomes/code/src/lib.rs`.

Open up the `lib.rs` file in an editor and let's have a look at the generated code.

The following are all the imports. You are telling Rust, "hey, I need things from all these [crates](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-01-packages-and-crates.html) in order to do my job."

\#S:INCLUDE
```rust
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene)]
extern crate hdk;
extern crate hdk_proc_macros;
extern crate serde;
#[macro_use]
extern crate serde_derive;
extern crate serde_json;
extern crate holochain_json_derive;
```

Next are the `use` statements. They are saying, "I want to use these specific things from the above crates."
You only need a few items for this tutorial so go ahead and remove the others:
\#S:SKIP
```diff
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene)]
- #[macro_use]
extern crate hdk;
extern crate hdk_proc_macros;
extern crate serde;
#[macro_use]
extern crate serde_derive;
extern crate serde_json;
- #[macro_use]
extern crate holochain_json_derive;
use hdk::{
-     entry_definition::ValidatingEntryType,
    error::ZomeApiResult,
};
- use hdk::holochain_core_types::{
-     entry::Entry,
-     dna::entry_types::Sharing,
- };

- use hdk::holochain_json_api::{
-     json::JsonString,
-     error::JsonError
- };

- use hdk::holochain_persistence_api::{
-    cas::content::Address
- };

use hdk_proc_macros::zome;
```
You should be left with this:

\#S:INCLUDE
```rust
use hdk::{
    error::ZomeApiResult,
};

use hdk_proc_macros::zome;
```

There are a few sections of generated code that are not useful for this tutorial. 

Remove the following piece of code:

\#S:SKIP
```diff
- #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, DefaultJson,Clone)]
- pub struct MyEntry {
-     content: String,
- }
```

The `my_zome` module is where all your zome code live. `#[zome]` is a [procedural macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html) that says that the following module defines all the things that Holochain should know about this zome. It saves you writing lots of code. 

Change it to `hello_zome` for this tutorial series:

```diff
#[zome]
- mod my_zome {
+ mod hello_zome {
```
\#S:INCLUDE,HIDE
```rust
#[zome]
mod hello_zome {
```

The `init` function is run when a user starts the app for the first time. Every zome defines this function so it can do some initial setup tasks. In this zome it doesn't do anything.

```rust
    #[init]
    fn init() {
```

Return success with the empty value `()`. In Rust `()` is called the [unit type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.unit.html) and is similar (though not identical) to a [void type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_type) in other languages.

```rust
        Ok(())
    }
```

This required function is run at application start too, once by the new user and once by the existing peers. It checks that the user is allowed to join the network. In this case it gives everyone a free pass.

\#S:INCLUDE
```rust
    #[validate_agent]
    pub fn validate_agent(validation_data: EntryValidationData<AgentId>) {
        Ok(())
    }
```

Remove the following template code:

\#S:SKIP
```diff
-      #[entry_def]
-      fn my_entry_def() -> ValidatingEntryType {
-         entry!(
-             name: "my_entry",
-             description: "this is a same entry defintion",
-             sharing: Sharing::Public,
-             validation_package: || {
-                 hdk::ValidationPackageDefinition::Entry
-             },
-             validation: | _validation_data: hdk::EntryValidationData<MyEntry>| {
-                 Ok(())
-             }
-         )
-     }
- 
-     #[zome_fn("hc_public")]
-     fn create_my_entry(entry: MyEntry) -> ZomeApiResult<Address> {
-         let entry = Entry::App("my_entry".into(), entry.into());
-         let address = hdk::commit_entry(&entry)?;
-         Ok(address)
-     }
- 
-     #[zome_fn("hc_public")]
-     fn get_my_entry(address: Address) -> ZomeApiResult<Option<Entry>> {
-         hdk::get_entry(&address)
-     }
```

> #### A note about return values
> 
> You'll often see Rust functions returning some sort of [`Result`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/) value. This is a special Rust type that can either be `Ok(some_value)` to show that the function succeeded or `Err(some_error)` to report an error. All required Holochain functions, such as init and validators, are expected return a special result type called [`ZomeApiResult`](https://developer.holochain.org/api/latest/hdk/error/type.ZomeApiResult.html), which shuttles data back and forth between your app and the conductor. It also automatically converts data to JSON and back, so it makes sense to use it in your public functions too.

## Add a function to say hello :)

Now tell the zome to return `Hello Holo` from a public function.

Locate the `validate_agent` function:

\#S:SKIP
```rust
    pub fn validate_agent(validation_data: EntryValidationData<AgentId>) {
      Ok(())
    }
```

You're going to put your public zome function after it.

The `hc_public` procedural macro will turn the function directly below it into a public function that GUIs, other zomes, and DNAs can call. It takes note of the function's name, the parameters it accepts, and the type of value it returns, so Holochain can call it properly.

Add the `hc_public` macro:

\#S:INCLUDE
```rust
    #[zome_fn("hc_public")]
```

The function `hello_holo` takes no arguments and returns a Holochain result type. We're also telling Holochain that if the result is `Ok` then it will contain a string.

Start the function:

```rust
    fn hello_holo() -> ZomeApiResult<String> {
```

Return an `Ok` result that contains our greeting. `into()` is a bit of Rust oddness that just means "turn this [slice](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/slice/) into a `String`":

```rust
        Ok("Hello Holo".into())
    }
```

\#S:HIDE
```rust
}
```

#### Compile 

\#S:CHECK=rust

> If you do find any errors, remember to fix them before moving on. You can always get help on the [forum](https://forum.holochain.org/t/about-the-getting-started-category/167).

!!! note "Run in `nix-shell`"
    ```bash
    hc package
    ```

## Talk to your app through HTTP

To interact with your application you can run it in HTTP mode.

Run your app in HTTP mode:
!!! note "Run in `nix-shell`"
    ```bash
    hc run -i http
    ```

You can send a [POST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)) message to your app using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), a little command for making HTTP requests. (It's included in the Holochain dev environment.)

You will need to open a new terminal window and enter the nix-shell again:

```bash
nix-shell https://holochain.love
```

Enter the following request, which will call the `hello_holo` function and return the result:

!!! note "Run in `nix-shell`"
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": "0", "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "call", "params": {"instance_id": "test-instance", "zome": "hello", "function": "hello_holo", "args": {} }}' http://127.0.0.1:8888
    ```

!!! success "And you should get back your string from the `hello_holo` function:"
    ```json
    {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"{\"Ok\":\"Hello Holo\"}","id":"0"}
    ```

Congratulations --- you have created your first distributed Holochain application! :rocket:
